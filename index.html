                    Hi,My is Oluwabunmi Ayeni also known as AYECO! I am a front end developer and aspiring full stack web developer. My pimary focus is to build a Front End Web Applications. My goal is to work with startups and large corporations to help build, learn & scale
                    their companies. I love doing this because I love the process of turning dreams to reality and for the passion that I have for it. With this passion, I have been able to work on myself to aid my personal development over the years.
                    In the process, I have learnt some top-notch technologies to enhance my skill sets I worked on some clone project like replicating Gmail App, LinkedIn App and Betting App as part of my work contributions on GitHub repo. I am a graduate
                    from Federal University of Technology, Akure in the department of Computer science. Have been able to get some hands-on experience and learn the skills that are required to help succeed in the real-world through friends and mentors.
                    On a side note, I love watching soccer, listening to music and surfing the internet for more update especially of tech.
